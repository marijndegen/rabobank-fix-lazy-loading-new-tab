# rabobank-fix-lazy-loading-new-tab
Rabobank has lazy loading enabled for listing of effects, however, it is not possible to open them in a new tab (nor through context menu, nor through crtl click). This extension adds a context menu entry when selecting text, when clicked it opens the effect in a new tab. Fill in your portofolio number in the "background.js" file.
